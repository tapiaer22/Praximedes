This module contains the class `LED_Source` that could be used to manipulate LED lights from Happy Lighting by using python code. All methods are async and awaitable, 

Initialization:

```
- **device_address**: the mac address of the BLE device (required)
- **logs**: output logs and messages to a file (optional)

Actions:
- **Connect**:
  <br>After initializing the class, you must use the `async connect()` method to start a BLE connection
```python
led = LED_Source("00:00:00:00:00:00")  #  Initialize class (with logs by default)
await led.connect()
await led.disconnect()
```
